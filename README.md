Takeaway Challenge
==================


User Stories
------------

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Strategy
--------

1. My first step was to breakdown the user stories into Objects and Messages.
2. Then I created a Sequence and Class diagram detailing how the Class interact.
3. I built the system with an IRB interface.
4. Then I investigated the Twilio API and implemented a text response when an order was submitted and verified.
5. Finally, I investigated POST requests and implemented a rudimentary SMS interface.
